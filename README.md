This is my first project from the Odin Project`s  Full-Stack Development Course.
This project showcases what I have learned on the first part of said course.
Right now, it mostly features basic HTML concepts such as displaying text, links, and images.
This project also allows me to practice my git/github skills as well as navigating the terminal,                               
so I can get used to usual workflow of a web developer.
